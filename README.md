Open Access Research
====================
As historians, we aren't all that accustomed to sharing our research notes. We go to the archives, we take our photographs, we spend *hours* pouring over documents, photographs, diaries, newspapers... why should someone else benefit from *our* work?

We will discuss how we can make our research notes open, what that implies for how
