+ EXERCISE 1: learning markdown syntax with dillinger.io

Have you ever fought with Word or another wordprocessor, trying to get things just _right_? Word processing is a mess. It conflates writing with typesetting and layout. Sometimes, you just want to get the words out. Othertimes, you want to make your writing as accessible as possible... but your intended recipient can't open your file, because they don't use the same wordprocessor. Or perhaps you wrote up some great notes that you'd love to have in a slideshow; but you can't, because copying and pasting preserves a whole lot of extra _gunk_ that messes up your materials.

The answer is to separate your _content_ from your tool:

> This is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles, sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least, your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor you are currently using stops working or “goes out of business.”

> Writing in this way liberates the author from the tool. Markdown can be written in any plain text editor and offers a rich ecosystem of software that can render that text into beautiful looking documents. For this reason, Markdown is currently enjoying a period of growth, not just as as means for writing scholarly papers but as a convention for online editing in general.

> Popular general purpose plain text editors include TextWrangler and Sublime for Mac, Notepad++ for Windows, as well as Gedit and Kate for Linux. However, there are also editors that specialize in displaying and editing Markdown.

In this exercise, I want you to become familiar with Markdown syntax. There are a number of 'flavours' for Markdown, but in essence, they all mimic the kinds of conventions you would see in an email, using asterisks to indicate emphasis and so on. 

1. You will need this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 
2. Go to [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) in a new browser window. This looks like a wordprocessor. The left hand side of the screen is where you write, the right hand side shows you what your text will look like. Dillinger 'saves' your work in your browser's memory. You can also point it to save to your dropbox, google drive, or github account (under the cogwheel icon. Do you have a dropbox etc account? You should set that up now, if you don't).
3. Write a short 200-500 word piece on why you are taking this class; what you hope to achieve here; the kind of digital experience you already have versus the kind of experience you wish to have.


+ EXERCISE 2: setting up a domain (webspace) of your own with reclaimhosting.com
+ EXERCISE 3: setting up a simple open notebook (blog + personal github repo + notational velocity or notation, as appropriate)
+ EXERCISE 4: forking & contributing to a repository (fork the syllabus, then add your name, blog site, open notebook, to it)
